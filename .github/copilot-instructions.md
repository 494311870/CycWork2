# CycWork Project - AI Agent Instructions

## Project Overview
This is a quantitative finance project focused on implementing index inclusion effect arbitrage strategies (指数纳入效应套利策略). The project workspace currently contains research documents and is set up for developing trading algorithms and analysis tools.

## Project Structure and Context
- **Core Documents**: Two key files contain the project requirements and specifications:
  - `作业3 （学生用）指数纳入效应套利策略的实现.docx` - Main project documentation
  - `作业3 （学生用）指数纳入效应套利策略的实现.xlsx` - Data analysis and calculations
- **Development Stage**: This project is in early stages, currently containing specification documents

## 使用中文输出结果

## 在文档/输出的结果中，需要给出详细的计算公式，如何用Excel之类的方式实现，并给出清晰的步骤说明。不允许只提供代码。

## Expected Development Patterns

### Code Organization
When implementing code for this project, expect to create:
- **Data processing modules** for handling financial market data
- **Strategy implementation** files for arbitrage algorithms
- **Backtesting frameworks** for validating strategies
- **Visualization tools** for performance analysis

### Financial Domain Conventions
- Use consistent naming for financial concepts (e.g., `inclusion_date`, `announcement_date`, `rebalancing_period`)
- Implement proper data validation for financial time series
- Handle market holidays and trading calendar considerations
- Follow risk management principles in strategy implementation

### Development Workflow
- **Data Sources**: Expect integration with financial data providers
- **Testing**: Implement both unit tests for individual components and backtesting for strategies
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of mathematical models and assumptions
- **Performance**: Focus on computational efficiency for large-scale data processing

## Key Implementation Areas

### Index Inclusion Effect Analysis
- Track announcement and inclusion dates for index changes
- Calculate abnormal returns around inclusion events
- Implement statistical significance testing

### Arbitrage Strategy Development
- Develop position sizing algorithms
- Implement risk controls and stop-loss mechanisms
- Create portfolio optimization routines

### Data Management
- Handle multiple data frequencies (daily, intraday)
- Implement data cleaning and outlier detection
- Manage corporate actions and stock splits

## Technical Considerations
- **Language Choice**: Python typically preferred for quantitative finance (pandas, numpy, scipy)
- **Performance**: Consider vectorized operations for large datasets
- **Dependencies**: Expect use of financial libraries (quantlib, zipline, backtrader)
- **Data Storage**: Plan for efficient storage of time series data

## Getting Started
1. Review the specification documents to understand requirements
2. Set up development environment with financial data analysis libraries
3. Implement data ingestion pipeline first
4. Develop strategy logic incrementally with proper testing
5. Create visualization tools for strategy performance analysis
